# console.label
> Automatically add variable names as labels to all your console.logs

## Why?
We've all experienced the horrors and misery of what happens when you fill your console with logs, and don't label any of them. So I label all my logs. Which is a bore, and extremely repetitive. `console.label` handles that automatically! 

## Use
```
var myFavoriteWebsite = 'aPlayfulDate.com';

console.label(myFavoriteWebsite);
// 'myFavoriteWebsite: aPlayfulDate.com'
```
